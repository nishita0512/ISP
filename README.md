# Internet Service Provider Application

This App implements a lot of essential features along with good UI/UX for user's internet service needs.

**This App works along with my 2 other projects**:
1. [ISP Admin](https://github.com/nishita0512/ISPAdmin): Admin control for this Application
2. [ISP REST-API](https://github.com/nishita0512/ISP-API): A server for communication between Admin and User. 

## Features

1. **Daily Data Usage**: The "Daily Data Usage" feature in your ISP (Internet Service Provider) Android application allows users to monitor their data usage on a daily basis. It provides real-time information about how much data they have consumed during a particular day. This feature helps users stay aware of their data usage and avoid exceeding their allocated data limits.
2. **Live Server Map**: The "Live Server Map" feature in your ISP Android application provides users with a visual representation of the network infrastructure and server status in real-time. It displays a map with the locations of your ISP's servers, along with indicators that show the status of each server.
3. **Customer chat support**: The "Customer Chat Support" feature in your ISP Android application enables users to have real-time conversations with customer support representatives directly through the app. It offers a convenient and efficient way for users to seek assistance, ask questions, or report any issues they may be experiencing with their internet service. It uses firestore to implement this chat system.

## Acknowledgements

**Libraries used:**

- [osmdroid-Mapview](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid): osmdroid is a (almost) full/free replacement for Android's MapView (v1 API) class. It also includes a modular tile provider system with support for numerous online and offline tile sources and overlay support with built-in overlays for plotting icons, tracking location, and drawing shapes.

- [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/payment-gateway/android-integration/standard): Razorpay Payments provide a range of products to accept payments and make payouts. It also offers solutions to add offers and assess risk associated with a customer order.

- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/): A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It handles all the conversions under the hood for request body and response request data.

- [OkHTTP](https://square.github.io/okhttp/): OkHttp perseveres when the network is troublesome: it will silently recover from common connection problems. If your service has multiple IP addresses, OkHttp will attempt alternate addresses if the first connect fails. This is necessary for IPv4+IPv6 and services hosted in redundant data centers.
